## ColourBot

A experimental twitter bot that automatically tweets a random colour every 5 minutes.


## Running

I wourld prefer if you dont run this bot yourself. This code is mainly for my own experimenting and education purposes.

Nevertheless, To run an instance of this bot, you'll need access to the Twitter API. Go to the [Twitter Developers](https://developer.twitter.com) to apply for access and create an application.

1. **Install the dependencies**

Just do `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

2. **Create the config file**

Create a file called `config.py` and put the following there:-

```py
API_KEY = ''
API_SECRET_KEY = ''
ACCESS_TOKEN = ''
ACCESS_SECRET = ''
#You'll get these info from your application page.
```
